Title: Parameter synthesis by using abstract interpretation in Parameter  Stochastic Automata Networks


Modeling and understanding of complex systems, particularly biological systems, 
often requires knowledge of the parameters that govern interactions between components. 
For some parameters, values or ranges of values can be obtained experimentally, 
but for others it remains difficult to decide.

In this preliminary work, we propose an approach based on the abstract interpretation 
of traces in Parametric Stochastic Automata Networks (PSAN), to synthesize the
optimal timing delays guaranteeing that the system satisfies a given quantitative property.
Properties of the system are express by using Concurrent Continous Stochastic Logic (CCSL)
and we relay to constraint programming for optimal parameter synthesis.
